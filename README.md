tic tac toe game made by using react and javascript
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.  The goal is to form a line of three of your marks (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or  diagonally. Building a Tic-Tac-Toe game is a great exercise to understand how to manage  the game state, update the UI based on user interactions, and determine the winner.
